## Description

This project was a challenge of design as well as functionality and coding. I wrote this app to illustrate the importance of flexbox as well as to provide a an opportunity to add interesting portfolios in the future. I included screenshots of my design process at the bottom of this README.

I designed the images individually in PowerPoint and eventually built an animation in PowerPoint and made a mockup gif. I then explored ways in which I could code the gif, and realised the limitations of CSS of on-scroll events.

I hope that in 3 months time (May 2022) I will be able to use Javascript and DOM Manipulation to make it even more interactive.
