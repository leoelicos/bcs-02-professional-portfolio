## Description

This project was a challenge of design as well as functionality and coding. I wrote this app to illustrate the importance of flexbox as well as to provide an opportunity to add interesting portfolios in the future. I included screenshots of my design process at the bottom of this README.

I designed the images individually in PowerPoint and eventually built an animation in PowerPoint and made a mockup gif. I then explored ways in which I could code the gif, and realised the limitations of CSS of on-scroll events. I hope that in 3 months time (May 2022) I will be able to use Javascript and DOM Manipulation to make it even more interactive.

### Timeframe

I spent about 80 hours on this project from creating the images to designing the code and testing for compatibility issues with iOS.

## Bugs

The app currently does not work fully in iOS Safari and iOS Chrome â€” see [Bugs](#bugs)

Tested this app on iPhone 11 Pro Max in Safari and Chrome and also iPhone 13 in Safari and the text flowed behind the mountains.

### Bug: iOS Safari and Chrome (fixed)

Text was appearing behind the mountains as Safari was not interpreting z-index.

I fixed this by adding `-webkit-transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0);` before `z-index`, triggering hardware acceleration in Safari to read positive z-index values. This allowed the text to properly layer over the background images.
