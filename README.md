## Description

This project was a challenge of design as well as functionality and coding. I wrote this app to illustrate the importance of flexbox as well as to provide an opportunity to add interesting work in the future. I designed the images individually as PNGs and composed the frames using only HTML and CSS.

The challenge of developing the website without Javascript is offset by the simplicity of what in my view a portfolio website should be â€” let the projects speak for themselves. Responsiveness was a challenge as I did not use Bootstrap and also the fixed resolution of my designed images made it challenging to be responsive on wider screens.

In future I plan to rework the PNGs into SVGs so they can fill the screen.
