## Description

This project was a challenge of design as well as functionality and coding. I wrote this app to illustrate the importance of flexbox as well as to provide an opportunity to add interesting portfolios in the future. I included screenshots of my design process at the bottom of this README.

I designed the images individually in PowerPoint and eventually built an animation in PowerPoint and made a mockup gif. I then explored ways in which I could code the gif, and realised the limitations of CSS of on-scroll events.

I hope that in 3 months time (May 2022) I will be able to use Javascript and DOM Manipulation to make it even more interactive.

The app currently does not work fully in iPhone 11 Pro Max Safari and Chrome â€” see [Known Bugs](##Known Bugs)

## Usage

To access the app, please open [Portfolio](https://leoelicos.github.io/bcs-02-portfolio/) in Chrome on a PC or Mac.

To move down the page, scroll down with your scroll button, or swipe up on your phone.

## Known Bugs

My friend tested this app on her iPhone 11 Pro Max in Safari and Chrome and the text flowed behind the mountains. This is a known bug but to fix it is beyond the limit of my current knowledge.

### Bug: iOS Safari

### Bug: iOS Chrome
